      "message": "The 130.0.6723.58 build transitions the ad block URL to about:blank if it is still www.bromite.org, because that\u0027s what Cromite does and I forgot to change it - I guess I figured I would handle it as part of this migration, which I originally was going to do for M130, but which was decided could be delayed.\n\nSo, any users who run a 130 build without this, who happened to still have a www.bromite.org URL, will be transitioned to about:blank. This change will fix that.\n\nIf they had filters downloaded before, those should still be cached, though, until they get this fix.",
