      "message": "Alternative is to figure out how to actually remove \"Add flag to disable external intent requests\" without breaking Chromium like one of the commit messages here mentions. Probably not the hardest thing, but I don\u0027t know how to do that either, and every little bit takes time.\n\nI don\u0027t know how to do either thing yet, so I\u0027m not sure which is easier. Probably the alternative though. We\u0027ll see.",

      "message": "I had a lot of poor luck trying to deal with this today, with the app crashing again. I looked up the instructions on how to debug the crash which didn\u0027t really help, so I added a debug line and can see that it crashes from trying to find the `AllowExternalIntentRequests` feature which doesn\u0027t exist. After digging into that a lot, I think the build is not getting properly cleaned and I\u0027m just doing a whole new build, even though it takes a long time. (At this point, it would have been faster to do that from the start, but it\u0027s sometimes not.)\n\nIf it works with that patch removed, I think we\u0027ll just go with that, since this has been quite a headache. It lines up with what we discussed anyway, removing the toggle.",

      "message": "For posterity, what I had been trying to do before trying to remove the patch again, was to rename it to `AllowExternalIntentRequests2` (something Chirayu had suggested, just using a different preference), but since I encountered the same crash for the same reason and I understand the reason now (I think), it\u0027s probably not worth it. This would have allowed advanced users to decide they *really* don\u0027t want to even be *asked* about launching apps, by changing Cromite flags.\n\nStill, we could always think about this again later. The existing toggle was hard to understand, so it makes sense to say goodbye to it.",
