      "message": "I might be misunderstanding this, but it seems like this change trades the convenience of reviewing and updating the args as a standalone file, with the convenience of having them nearer-by when including as the actual build args (yet not having it be a floating, untracked file)... Is that right?",

Otherwise, there\u0027s stll manual copying and changing involved that could get missed and become confusing.",
