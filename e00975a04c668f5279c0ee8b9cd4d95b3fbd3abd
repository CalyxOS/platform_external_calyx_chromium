      "message": "I might be misunderstanding this, but it seems like this change trades the convenience of reviewing and updating the args as a standalone file, with the convenience of having them nearer-by when including as the actual build args (yet not having it be a floating, untracked file)...

      "message": "\u003e The benefit of having it be a patch is we always have a nice 1:1 mapping between what was built.\n\nI like that concept, though I do wish it was less error-prone, e.g. if we had another change to ensure that the build always uses this args.gn instead of the one in the output folder. Otherwise, there\u0027s stll manual copying and changing involved that could get missed and become confusing.",
