      "message": "The absence of the `RegisterFeatureOverrides` call is breaking WebView.\n\nEven more specifically, before that method even does anything with the provided `feature_list`, it sets a series of hard-coded feature overrides tailored for WebView. One of these is now essential, or a crash occurs: `aw_feature_overrides.DisableFeature(::features::kEnableDrDc);`. The other overrides can be absent without leading to an immediate crash of WebView apps.\n\nFor compatibility, it might be best if we continue to call this method and allow it to set the defaults, which look reasonable.",
