      "message": "So it sounds like disabling this prevents the user from deciding they want third-party cookies again, if I understand it correctly...? Or something like that? No one knew Chromium could be so complicated.\n\nI don\u0027t think I care very much about this one way or the other, so the easy route is to copy and paste this explanation (since it took a while to find) and keep it as-is in this patchset otherwise; I believe we\u0027re currently doing what Brave does, which causes the described behavior (if I\u0027m even interpreting it right), and that seems fine enough.\n\n[Previous release notes - Chrome Enterprise and Education Help](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/10314655?hl\u003den#126\u0026#125\u0026#124\u0026#123\u0026#122\u0026#121\u0026#120\u0026#119\u0026#118\u0026#117\u0026#116\u0026#115\u0026#114\u0026#113\u0026#112\u0026#111\u0026#110\u0026#109\u0026#108\u0026#107\u0026#106\u0026#105\u0026#104\u0026#103\u0026#102\u0026#101\u0026#100\u0026)\n\n\u003e **Chrome Third-Party Cookie Deprecation (3PCD)** [![back to top](https://storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/875e9907-0d60-4f4e-a960-862bc24a29f4)](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/10314655?hl\u003den#top)  \n\u003e   \n\u003e In Chrome 120 and beyond (Jan 2024), Chrome will globally disable third-party cookies for 1% of Chrome traffic as part of our [Chrome-facilitated testing](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/privacy-sandbox/chrome-testing/) in collaboration with the [CMA](https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/investigation-into-googles-privacy-sandbox-browser-changes). The facilitated testing period allows sites to meaningfully preview what it\u0027s like to operate in a world without third-party cookies. As [bounce-tracking protections](https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/protections/bounce-tracking-mitigations) are also a part of 3PCD, the users in this group with third-party cookies blocked will have bounce tracking mitigations take effect, so that their state is cleared for sites that get classified as a bounce tracker. Most enterprise users should be excluded from this experiment group automatically; however, we recommend that admins proactively use the [BlockThirdPartyCookies](https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#BlockThirdPartyCookies) and [CookiesAllowedForUrls](https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#CookiesAllowedForUrls) policies to re-enable third-party cookies and opt out their managed browsers ahead of the experiment. This will give enterprises time to make the changes required to not rely on this policy or third-party cookies.   \n\u003e   \n\u003e We plan to provide more tooling (such as the [Legacy Tech Report](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/7679408#upAdminConC120))  to help identify third-party cookies use cases. Admins can set the [BlockThirdPartyCookies policy](https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#BlockThirdPartyCookies) to false to re-enable third-party cookies for all sites but this will prevent users from changing the corresponding setting in Chrome. Alternatively, to prevent breakage, you can set the [CookiesAllowedForUrls](https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#CookiesAllowedForUrls) policy to allowlist your enterprise applications to continue receiving third-party cookies.  \n\u003e   \n\u003e For enterprise end users that are pulled into this experiment group and that are not covered by either enterprise admin policy, they can use the User Bypass control (the “eye icon” in the omnibox)  to temporarily re-enable third-party cookies for 90 days on a given site when necessary. Enterprise admin policies override User Bypass controls, for example, setting [BlockThirdPartyCookies policy](https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#BlockThirdPartyCookies) to true will disable third-party cookies for all sites and prevent users from using this User Bypass control.  \n\u003e   \n\u003e [Bounce tracking protections](https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/protections/bounce-tracking-mitigations) are also covered by the same policies as cookies and enforced when the bouncing site is not permitted to have/receive 3P cookies. Thus, setting the [BlockThirdPartyCookies](https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#BlockThirdPartyCookies) policy to false, or setting the [CookiesAllowedForUrls](https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#CookiesAllowedForUrls) policy for a site, will prevent bounce tracking mitigations from deleting state for sites.",
