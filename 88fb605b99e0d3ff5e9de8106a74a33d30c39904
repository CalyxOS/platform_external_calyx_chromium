      "message": "Privacy Sandbox is properly off by default.\n\nSome demos here: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/privacy-sandbox/demos\n\nFailing demos (good; these fail even with Privacy Sandbox APIs flag on and ad-blocking off, which is good; also tested these on stock to ensure they do work somewhere and to be able to compare):\n- Protected Audience API: publisher page comes up empty.\n- Topics API: no topics are ever listed.\n- Attribution Reporting: demo reports an issue, and chrome://attribution-internals shows it is disabled.\n- Shared Storage: A mess to test, but e.g. you cannot submit the Survey; usually it changes from Submit to Continue. Also chrome://private-aggregation-internals remains empty no matter what you click.\n- Private State Token: Does not proceed pass \"Issuing token\", even with command line arguments to enable features.\n\nDemos that work, but it\u0027s good:\n- Permissions Policy: Works.\n- User Agent Reduction: It\u0027s always enabled for us, doesn\u0027t need origin trial, and appears to work.\n\nDemos of unknown status (this is not blocking):\n- CHIPS: Hard to say, but it never shows any cookies in the Site B iframe on the main test page, which is different from stock Chrome.\n- First-Party Sets: Doesn\u0027t show [PASS] for anything even with the command-line stuff, hard to proceed.",
