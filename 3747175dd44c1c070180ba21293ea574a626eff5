For example, with a typical `chromium/src` path, if there\u0027s anything sensitive in `chromium` that wouldn\u0027t typically be used by the build process, it may be accessible by the build process now.\n\nIf that\u0027s the case, I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s necessarily a dealbreaker, but it should be determined and documented accordingly.",
