Seems like NDEFReader is not available, are you on Android/Chrome?\" failure when tapping Check.\nCurrent (and maybe previous) Cromite receives \"Well done! NDEFReader is available and below examples should work.\"\n\nHowever, to actually *read* from an NFC tag, a popup appears requesting permission, and the permission from then on shows up as \"NFC devices\" in the site settings. It can also be blocked globally in Site Settings, but when doing so, tapping Check still shows the \"Well done!\" message, which I think means that sites can probe for availability of NFC.\n\nI can\u0027t currently think of a good use case for WebNFC and presume Brave is disabling it out of an abundance of preference for security / to prevent some fingerprinting, but I am not sure.\n\nI will try what Brave did to keep WebNfc unavailable: https://github.com/brave/brave-core/commit/624228f9f9e5d45065fd9e0cdbcd4d2b4bb9e8ba",
