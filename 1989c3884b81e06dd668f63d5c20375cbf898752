      "message": "The `git_` functions should have their respective `find_` functions called, at the top, bailing out when not found. Yes, there\u0027s the potential for redundant calls, but currently, if the *user* tries to use one of these `git_` functions, there\u0027s no guarantee the paths have been initialized.\n\nFor example, I tried to use `git_cromite status` and it did not reflect the cromite repo! The command was treated as `git -C \"\" status`, which is apparently valid and makes git use the current directory. Not desirable!",

      "message": "These `${1:-..}` constructions were added to support outputting and updating patches when working in a different src dir (src2). It can be supplied as an argument to update_patches, etc. But in retrospect, maybe `CHROMIUM_SRC_PATH\u003d\"$(pwd)\" update_patches` or something would be cleaner.",
